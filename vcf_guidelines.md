# Violet Crown Festival Vendor Guidelines 
 
- All artist products must be handmade by the artist and must be in good taste.
It is acceptable to have helpers in the booth, but the artist must be present
the day of the show. 
 
- Tax ID Certificate must be displayed in your booth.  See the
  [comptroller.texas.gov website](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/96-211.php) for
  details on state laws.
 
- A 10x10 booth/space is provided for each artist.  You are responsible for
bringing your own tents, tables, and chairs (please note, no electricity will be
available). Weights for tents are required.  You will not be allowed to set up
without a tent and weights (25 lbs. per leg).  If you do not have a tent this
does not apply.  Stakes to secure tents are not allowed in the park – please do
not use stakes. 
 
- Set up begins at 8:00 AM, please be ready for business by 10:00 AM. 
 
- We require artists to leave close-in parking open for festival guests.  Please
note that this will be monitored during the load-in process. 
 
- The festival will take place rain or shine. There is no rain date. 
 
-  Please properly dispose of trash from your space – feel free to use
trash/recycling receptacles that are on the grounds for reasonable amounts of
refuse. 
 
- We request that you remain “open” during festival hours.  If you must leave
early, please make arrangements with us in advance. 
 
-  Cancellation Policy: If you find that you are unable to fulfill your
obligation, please do us the courtesy of canceling by April 20, 2025 to receive
a full refund.  Cancellations after April 20th will be refunded based on the
discretion of the Violet Crown Festival Board.  If you do not show up by 10:00
AM the day of the show, you run the risk of losing your space to a vendor on the
waiting list.
