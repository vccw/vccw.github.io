### Details

Art, music and more on tap at this year's festival!

There's no better way to enjoy a spring Saturday than by spending it at the
Violet Crown Festival. Admission is free.

For 2025, we're also holding our first neighborhood BBQ challenge.
Teams from across Brentwood, Crestview, and the surrounding neighborhoods
will compete to make the most delicious BBQ, with tickets available for
the public to come sample their meats and vote on their favorite.

To get up-to-date information, check the [Violet Crown Festival event page on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/492192407976759/).
We are making frequent updates there with announcements of artists and activities.

### Getting There

The festival is in Brentwood Park, just north of the swimming pool area. Some
parking is available in the neighborhood, but we encourage you to walk, bike,
or take Capitol Metro bus service.  Bus lines 3, 5, 320, and 803 are all within
a fifteen minute walk of the park.
