### Violet Crown Festival is Back

After a COVID-hiatus, we've regrouped and will be holding the Violet Crown
Festival again in 2025 on the first Saturday of May, the 3rd.

This year we are going to do something new and exciting, an amateur BBQ brisket cook-off contest.
If you are interested in competing please reach out!

Details are being firmed up, but we're actively recruiting volunteers
and sponsors for the event.

You can get the latest updates on the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/VioletCrownCommunityWorks">Violet Crown Community Works Facebook page</a>.
