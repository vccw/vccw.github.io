# Violet Crown Festival Returns on May 2nd

It's been a busy year in our neighborhoods, and we're happy to announce that Violet Crown Festival is happening again.
As usual, it's on the first Saturday in May.  We should have the first phase of new playground equipment completed
in Brentwood park, and our beloved Brentwood Elementary will have not yet started its major construction, so it will
be a great time to be outside enjoying Spring with your fellow Austinites.

If you're an artist wishing to have a booth at the event, see [our application page](vcf_apply.html).

If you're a business or individual who wants to help sponsor the event, see [our sponsorship form](vcf_sponsor.html).
