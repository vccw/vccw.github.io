# Coming in May, the Violet Crown Festival!

We're happy to announce the Spring 2019 Violet Crown Festival,
back again at Brentwood Park.

We've got a full lineup of bands, over 50 art vendors, and some great food!

If you would like to volunteer to help with the festival,
please see our <a href="https://www.givepulse.com/group/events/238305">sign-up page</a>.
We have needs in setup, teardown, and during the festival.

If you want to help sponsor the festival, please see our <a href="docs/VCF%202019%20sponsorship%20packet.pdf">2019 Sponsorship packet</a>.

We will be posting a lot of details both on the
<a href="vcf_2019.html">VCF 2019 web page</a> and on
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/492192407976759/">our Facebook page.</a>
