## Violet Crown Festival is Back!

After a COVID-hiatus, we've regrouped and will be holding the
<a href="vcf_2025">Violet Crown Festival</a> again in 2025 on the first
Saturday of May, the 3rd.

This year we are going to do something new and exciting, an amateur BBQ brisket
cook-off contest called the Violet Crown Barbecue Showdown.  If you are
interested in competing, please <a href="bbq">fill out our BBQ Showdown
interest form</a>.

If you're interesting in being a sponsor, please
<a href="vcf_sponsor">see our sponsorship form</a>.

If you want to exhibit and sell your artwork at the festival,
see <a href="vcf_apply">our artist signup submission form</a> for details.

If you'd like to help as a volunteer on the day of the festival,
please see <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0A4AA5A829ABFA7-55767989-event">the festival's
