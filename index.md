Thanks to everyone that helped put together the Spring 2018 Violet Crown Festival, including all the volunteers, vendors, sponsors, and attentees.

We'll be back in the neighborhood in October with the 2nd Annual Violet Crown Oktoberfest, up over in the parking lot by the Wall of Welcome.  Details to come later in the summer.
