### Violet Crown Festival is Back

After a COVID-hiatus, we've regrouped and will be holding the
<a href="vcf_2025">Violet Crown Festival</a> again in 2025 on the first
Saturday of May, the 3rd.

This year we are going to do something new and exciting, an amateur BBQ brisket
cook-off contest called the Violet Crown Barbecue Showdown.  If you are
interested in competing, please <a href="bbq">fill out our BBQ Showdown
interest form</a>.

If you're interesting in being a sponsor, please
<a href="vcf_sponsor">see our sponsorship form</a>.

We will announce sign up for artists and volunteers soon.

You can get the latest updates on the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/VioletCrownCommunityWorks">Violet Crown Community Works Facebook page</a>.
