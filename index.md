We at Violet Crown Community Works are acting as a fiscal sponsor for a new neighborhood group, the Violet Crown Care Committee.

<img src="img/vc_care_map.jpg" class="img-responsive">

The Violet Crown Care Network was formed by Crestview, Brentwood, and
Allandale neighborhood leaders to assist neighbors during the COVID-19
pandemic. They are working hard to provide aid to our community by helping
friends and neighbors with grocery shopping, medical care, or other essentials
people may need.
