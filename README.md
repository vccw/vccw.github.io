This site is powered by Jekyll which runs automatically as part of the GitHub Pages deploy process.
Most content is edited in Markdown, although due to style concerns, we often have to put HTML markup into the pages.

This site also uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for styles and
the [Bootswatch Spacelab theme](http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/) to make it prettier.
