Due to the Covid-19 Outbreak, the 2020 Violet Crown Festival has been canceled. If you are an artist who
has already submitted an application with payment, refunds will be made via PayPal within 2 weeks; similarly
food vendors will be refunded their festival fees in full. Paid sponsors are also entitled to a refund, or
can opt to donate sponsorship funds to help cover our non-refundable expenditures. In exchange for this
support, Violet Crown will continue to promote your business on our website and social media through
the end of summer.
